Notes about the data: 
	- Collected by scraping airbnb.com website via python
	- Note from author: "All listings found in any survey do exist on the Airbnb site. There is evidence from Airbnb statements that the listings are fairly complete. Here are some statements made by Airbnb or by others who have access to internal Airbnb data, and some notes."
	
The dataset comprises of three main tables:
listings - Detailed listings data showing 96 attributes for each of the listings. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are price(continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), ratings (continuous) among others.
w
reviews - Detailed reviews given by the guests with 6 attributes. Key attributes include date (datetime), listing_id (discrete), reviewer_id (discrete) and comment (textual).

calendar - Provides details about booking for the next year by listing. Four attributes in total including listing_id (discrete), date(datetime), available (categorical) and price (continuous).

room_type
One of the three room types listed above.

country
For example, “United States” or “Italy”

city
As entered in the page. This value may not match the search_area. For example, many listings have Brooklyn as the city even though they appear in the New York search_area. The city field is not used much in any analysis.

neighborhood
This value may not match the neighborhood in the search, as search results commonly include listings from other neighborhoods. It is difficult to extract reliably from the Airbnb pages, and should not be taken too seriously.

address
The street address (which generally does not include a street number) is also difficult to extract reliably from the web page, as it is entered by the host. It should not be taken too seriously.

reviews
The number of reviews for the listing. Unfortunately, the individual reviews are not collected.

overall_satisfaction
For listings that have at least three reviews, this is the overall satisfaction (on a one-to-five star rating, including half-stars). Individual ratings (eg cleanliness) are not collected.

accommodates
The number of people that the listing accommodates, according to the host.

bedrooms
If listed, the number of bedrooms.

bathrooms
If listed, the number of bathrooms.

price
The price listed by the host. This is almost always the price per night, but there are listings for which it is a price per week. Unfortunately, the script does not make this distinction. The price is collected in the currency displayed on the web page, which depends on the location from which the search is carried out. All my surveys record prices in $Cdn, for example.

deleted
If the page does not appear, it is marked as deleted by entering a 1 in this column.

minstay
The minimum number of nights that the listing is available for, according to the host.

last_modified
A timestamp recording when the script collected the data.

latitude
The latitude, as listed in the web page source.

longitude
The longitude, as listed in the web page source. For individual listings it is not clear that these values are always accurate. In general, however, they are close to the listing location.

survey_id
The survey being recorded. A single room may be visited several times in repeat surveys.
